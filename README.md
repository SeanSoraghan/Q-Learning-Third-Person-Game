The project is built from scratch, without the use of any templates or starter content. C++ classes are implemented for base functionality, which are then inherited by blueprint classes in the editor.
### Make Human
http://www.makehuman.org/
A great tool for developers without knowledge or skills in artistic 3D modelling. It allows you to create humanoid meshes and rigs using a slider-based interface.

### Blender

The characters created in Make Human were imported into Blender in order to create animations, which were then imported into Unreal.
