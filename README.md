# Q-Learning-Third-Person-Game
Demo top-down maze game made with the Unreal engine that makes use of action-value reward tables for enemy behaviour.

The project is built from scratch, without the use of any templates or starter content. C++ classes are implemented for base functionality, which are then inherited by blueprint classes in the editor.

WASD for movement. Hold RMB to aim, click LMB to fire. While aiming, hold shift for turret placement. Press E to place turret.
